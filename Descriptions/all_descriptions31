Description of Streptococcus suivaginalis sp. nov.
 Streptococcus suivaginalis (su.i.va.gi.na'lis. L. masc. or fem. n. sus, swine; L. fem. n. vagina, vagina; L. adj. suff. -alis, suffix denoting pertaining to; N.L. masc. adj. suivaginalis, associated with pig vagina).
Gram-stain positive, non-spore-forming and non-motile cocci, occurring in pairs and small clusters. Colonies on blood agar plates are small, circular and non-pigmented, approximately 1mm in diameter and -haemolytic at 37C. Catalase-negative and oxidase-negative. Cells grow well in THY +5% filtered heat-inactivated horse serum, TSB and THIO at 37C in ambient air or 5% CO2 atmosphere during 2448h. Cells can grow at temperatures between 30 and 42C under both ambient air and anaerobic conditions, with optimal growth observed between 35 and 38C, but do not grow in the presence of 6.5% NaCl. Using API Rapid ID32 Strep (bioMrieux), cells were able to produce acid from mannitol, lactose, glycogen, pullulan, maltose and sucrose, but not from methyl--d-glucopyranoside, tagatose, ribose, sorbitol, trehalose, raffinose, l-arabinose, d-arabitol, cyclodextrin, melibiose and melezitose. Cells were able to produce -galactosidase and alanylpheylalanylprolinearylamidase, but no activity was detected for -glucosidase, -glucuronidase, -galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, N-acetyl--glucosaminidase, glycyltryptophan arylamidase and -mannosidase. VogesProskauer test was negative. Arginine, hippurate and urea were not hydrolysed. Cells tested negative for Lancefield group A, B, C, D, F or G.
The type strain, 29896T (=NRRL B-65677T=NCTC 14941T), was isolated from a vaginal swab of a healthy pig during a routine veterinary physical exam. The full habitat is not known. The DNA G-C content of the type strain is 43.4mol%. The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence and chromosome are CP118733 and OR652396, respectively.

 Streptococcus iners (in'ers. L. masc. adj. iners, inert, inactive).
Gram-stain positive, non-spore-forming non-motile cocci occurring in pairs or chains usually 10 or more cells long. Good growth occurs on either TSA with 5% sheep blood or Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. Colonies on blood agar plates are small, circular and non-pigmented, approximately 1mm in diameter and -haemolytic at 37C. Catalase-negative and oxidase-negative. Cells grow well in THY +5% filtered heat-inactivated horse serum, TSB and THIO at 37C in ambient air or 5% CO2 atmosphere during 2448h.

The type strain, 29887T (=NRRL B-65675T=NCTC 14939T), was isolated from a vaginal swab of a healthy pig during a routine veterinary physical exam. The full habitat is not known. The DNA G-C content of the type strain is 42.1mol%. The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank with the accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence, chromosome and plasmid are OR654109, CP118735 and CP118736, respectively.
The species contains one subspecies.

 Description of Streptococcus iners SUBSP. hyiners SUBSP. nov.Description of Jannaschia maritima sp. nov.
 Jannaschia maritima (ma.ri'ti.ma. L. fem. adj. maritima, marine, referring to the isolation of the type strain from the marine environment).
The bacterial cells are Gram-stain-negative, oval- or coccoid-shaped, non-motile, and coccus-shaped (0.82.0m long and 0.91.6m wide). Colonies are red, transparent, circular and smooth on 2216E marine agar after 96h of cultivation at 25C. Bacteria can grow on 2216E marine broth at 1040C (optimum 25C), at pH 5.08.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and in NaCl concentrations of 17% (optimum 4%). Hydrolysis of aesculin and gelatin is observed; d-glucose fermentation, -galactosidase and nitrate reduction are weakly positive. Cells are positive for the activities of oxidase, catalase, gelatinase, alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, -glucosidase and N-acetyl--glucosaminase. Cells are susceptible to nalidixic acid, vancomycin and aztreonam, but resistant to rifamycin SV, fusidic acid and lincomycin. The carbon compounds (n=24) present in the Biolog GENIII systems, including six carbohydrates, nine carboxylic acids, four amino acids, three polymers, one amine and one fatty acid, are not utilized as sole carbon sources for growth and active metabolism. The major fatty acids are summed feature 8 (C18:17c/C18:16c) and C18:0. Q-10 is the sole respiratory quinone. The polar lipid profile was composed of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phospholipids, diphosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified polar lipids.
The type strain LMIT008T (=MCCC 1K08854T=KCTC 8321T) was isolated from the biofilm on the surface of concrete breakwater structures. The genome size of LMIT008T is 3.67 Mbp. The genomic DNA G+C content is 69.83mol%. The GenBank accession number for 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain LMIT008T is PQ516808. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number JARGZA000000000.
