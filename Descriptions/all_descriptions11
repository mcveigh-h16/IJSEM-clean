Description of Dolosigranulum savutiense sp. nov.
 Dolosigranulum savutiense (sa.vu.ti.ense. N.L. neut. adj. savutiense, pertaining to Savuti, Botswana, a geographical region of cultural significance in the country in which these strains were identified).
Cells are Gram-positive, catalase-negative, oxidase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile cocci (1.52.0 m long and 1.21.5 m wide). Optimal growth on solid medium was observed on tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood with incubation aerobically at 37 C in a 5% CO2-enriched environment. Colonies on this medium are small and appear grey or white with a flat, smooth surface and variable alpha haemolysis. Optimal growth in liquid medium was observed in FBB; growth in BHI broth was also observed. In biochemical testing, strains were found to lack catalase and oxidase activity but to have pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity and to hydrolyse hippuric acid. Fermentation of d-mannitol, d-sorbitol, lactose, and starch was variable across strains. Broad zones of inhibition were observed against all strains for many common antibiotics. The major fatty acids identified were palmitic (C16:0; mean of 21.9%), oleic (C18:1 9c; mean of 20.4%), and stearic (C18:0; mean of 17.0%) acids. The mean (range) genome size and DNA G+C content were 2.03 (1.982.07) Mbp and 39.7 (39.639.9) mol%, respectively.
The type strain, MSK294T (=DSM 117171T=JCM 36673T), was isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab collected in April 2019 from an 11-month-old female infant in a rural area near Gaborone, Botswana (latitude: 24.647728, longitude: 25.824646). The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MSK294T is available in GenBank (accession number: PP193857). The GenBank accession numbers for the genomic sequences of the D. savutiense sp. nov. strains described in this study are GCA_039830105.1 (MSK211), GCA_039830095.1 (MSK294T=DSM 117171T=JCM 36673T), GCA_039830085.1 (MSK312), and GCA_039830075.1 (MSK433).
 Description of Dolosigranulum savutiense sp. nov.Description of Shewanella scandinavica sp. nov.
 Shewanella scandinavica (scan.di.navi.ca. N.L. fem. adj. scandinavica, inflected form of scandinvicus, Scandinavia, because of its geographical origin).
Cells are rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, and motile. On average, cells are 2.23 m long and 0.64 m wide. Growth is satisfactory in Millers LB agar, where it forms smooth, convex, circular colonies. Growth is also satisfactory on marine agar, blood agar, and Lyngbys iron agar, where it forms black deposits because of its capacity to produce H2S. The type strain does not produce haemolysis on blood agar. Growth of the type strain occurs optimally at pH 6.58.5, and at 430C (optimally at 2330C). The type strain does not require NaCl for growth and is slightly halotolerant (up to 4.5% NaCl). The type strain is catalase-negative and positive for oxidase, ornithine decarboxylase, and DNAse reactions, can hydrolyse Tween 80 and gelatin, and can reduce nitrate and nitrite.
The type strain can assimilate lactate, and lactate+methionine, but not trehalose, arginine, norleucin or sucrose. Oxidation-versus-fermentation tests for the type strain are negative for maltose, d-glucose, adonitol, d-fructose and d-xylose.
In the commercial API 20 NE strip, the type strain is positive for assimilating glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, maltose, gluconate, adipate, malate, and citrate. Negative reactions are recorded for tryptophanase, glucose fermentation, arginine dihydrolase, urease, aesculin hydrolysis, PNPG -galactosidase, and the assimilation of the following carbon sources: l-arabinose, d-mannose, d-mannitol, caprate and phenylacetate.
In the commercial API ZYM strip, the type strain is positive for the following enzymatic activities: alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), ester lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, and phosphoamidase. Negative activities are recorded for lipase (C14), valine arylamidase, cysteine arylamidase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, acid phosphatase, -galactosidase, -galactosidase, -glucuronidase, -glucosidase, -glucosidase, N-acetyl--glucosaminidase, -mannosidase and -fucosidase.
The type strain is SP2S1-2T (CCUG 76457T=CECT 30688T), isolated from sediments collected in Vaxholm, Sweden. The size of its draft genome sequence is 5041805 bp, with a G+C content of 46.3mol% (GenBank accession: JAUOES000000000). Its nearly complete 16S rRNA sequence (1401 bp) is available from GenBank under accession OP758209. Other whole genome sequenced strains belonging to this species are VAX-SP4-0CM-4 (GenBank accession: JBCHKS000000000) and VAX-SP4-0CM-7 (GenBank accession: JBCHKR000000000).
