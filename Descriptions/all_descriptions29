Glycine is utilized as the sole nitrogen source, but histidine is not utilized.
The G+C content of the type-strain genome is 74.5%, with an approximate size of 5.8 Mbp. The accession numbers of the genome of strain P. alni subsp. carboxydivorans JCM 14827T is JBBPIX000000000.
The type strain is JCM 14827T (= Y8T = SWP-2006T = KCCM 42678T = DSM 45349T).

 Vishniacozyma siamensis (si.am.ensis. N.L. fem. adj. siamensis, of or belonging to Siam, the old name of Thailand, where the type strain was isolated).
After 7days at 25C on YM agar, the colony is cream-coloured, convex and has an entire margin (Fig. 2a, b). The yeast cells are subglobose to ovoid (1.21.8m1.62.9m). Multilateral budding is observed (Fig. 2c). Pseudohyphae are not formed in slide culture on PDA after 7days at 25C. Ballistospore formation is not observed on YM agar, 5% malt extract agar and corn meal agar after 14days at 25C. Sexual reproduction is not observed on PDA, corn meal agar, 5% malt extract agar, YPD agar, YM agar, Fowells acetate agar and Gorodkowa agar at 15 and 25C after 4weeks. Fermentation of glucose is negative. d-Glucose, d-galactose, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, methyl -d-glycoside, salicin, succinate, erythritol, d-gluconate, xylitol, d-ribose (or delayed positive), glycerol, ethanol (variable), l-sorbose, d-arabinose, inulin, ribitol, dl-lactate (positive or weak), N-acetyl glucosamine, d-galacturonic acid (or weak), d-glucitol, d-glucono-1,5-lactone, myo-inositol (or slow positive), d-xylose, sucrose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, melibiose, melizitose, lactose, raffinose, d-mannitol, galactitol are assimilated, but d-glucuronate, citrate, are not.
