Cells are rod-shaped, anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, spore-forming, motile and 3-HB-producing. Colonies growing on AV-glucose agar in Hungate tubes are small (<0.2 mm), circular and white. Cells are 1.83.6 m long and 0.350.45 m wide. Growth of cells occurs in a temperature range of 1937 C with an optimum at 37 C (no growth was observed at 4 C and from 40 C to 55 C), and in a pH range of 69, optimum being pH 7. Organic acids are produced from carbohydrates fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose and xylose as well as from yeast extract. No cell growth occurs using the substrates inositol, lactate, starch, rhamnose and raffinose. Fermentative end-products from growth on glucose are 3-HB, acetate, ethanol and H2. The cell contains a chromosome of an estimated size of 4.7 Mb containing four rRNA operons. No plasmids were detected. The genomic data were deposited in NCBI/ENA/DDBJ under the accession number CP146256.1, and the 16S rRNA sequence, at the GenBank database, under accession number PP429277. The genome harbours genes forming a bcs operon and a complete gene cluster encoding the Rnf complex. It also carries a five-nif-gene-set (nifHDKEB) involved in N2 fixation. Furthermore, genes encoding proteins involved in flagellum apparatus and chemotaxis are present.
