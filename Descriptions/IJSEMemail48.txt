Description of Comamonas trifloxystrobinivorans sp. nov.
 Comamonas trifloxystrobinivorans (tri.flo.xy.stro.bi.ni.vorans. N.L. neut. n. trifloxystrobinum, trifloxystrobin; L. pres. part. vorans, eating; N.L. part. adj. trifloxystrobinivorans, eating trifloxystrobin).
Cells are Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, motile and rod-shaped (0.51.0m wide and 1.52.2m long). Colonies of strain J-3T are semi-transparent and smooth with irregular edges after incubation for 2days at 30C on TSA plates. The strain grows in the presence of 01.0%NaCl (w/v, optimum, 0.5%), at 1535C (optimum, 30C) and at pH 5.08.0 (optimum, pH 7.5) and degrades 59.9% of 75.0M trifloxystrobin. Growth is observed on TSA, LB medium, NA and R2A medium, but not on marine medium. In API 20NE assays, positive for reduction of nitrate to nitrite, -glucosidase, -galactosidase, urease, assimilation of caprate, adipate, malate, citrate and phenylacetate, negative for denitrification, indole production, d-glucose fermentation, arginine dihydrolase, gelatin hydrolysis, d-glucose, l-arabinose, d-mannose, mannitol, N-acetyl-glucosamine, d-maltose and potassium gluconate. In API 20E tests, positive for citrate utilization and acetoin production, negative for lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, H2S production, tryptophan deaminase, indole production, gelatinase, glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin and arabinose. In API ZYM tests, positive for alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), lipase (C14), leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, trypsin, -chymotrypsin, naphtol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and -galactosidase, negative for -glucuronidase, -glucosidase, -glucosidase, N-acetyl--glucosaminidase, -mannosidase and -fucosidase. In Biolog GEN III assays, positive for 1% sodium lactate, fusidic acid, d-aspartic acid, glycyl-l-proline, l-aspartic acid, l-glutamic acid, l-histidine, l-pyroglutamic acid, l-serine, d-saccharic acid, tetrazolium violet, tetrazolium blue, p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid, methyl pyruvate, d-lactic acid methyl ester, l-lactic acid, citric acid, -keto-glutaric acid, -hydroxy-butyric acid, -keto-butyric acid, acetoacetic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, aztreonam, sodium butyrate, dextrin, gentiobiose, d-galactose, d-fucose, l-fucose, glycerol, l-alanine, d-galacturonic acid, l-galactonic acid lactone and glucuronamide, negative for d-maltose, d-trehalose, d-cellobiose, sucrose, d-turanose, stachyose, d-raffinose, -d-lactose, d-melibiose, -methyl-d-glucoside, d-salicin, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, N-acetyl--d-mannosamine, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, -d-glucose, d-mannose, d-fructose, 3-methyl glucose, l-rhamnose, inosine, d-sorbitol, d-mannitol, d-arabitol, myo-inositol, d-serine, gelatin, l-arginine, niaproof 4, pectin, d-gluconic acid, d-glucuronic acid, mucic acid, quinic acid, d-malic acid, l-malic acid, bromo-succinic acid, nalidixic acid, lithium chloride, potassium tellurite, Tween 40, -aminobutryric acid and sodium bromate. Colonies are susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, amikacin, colistin sulphate, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and streptomycin, while resistant to kanamycin, gentamicin, lincomycin, penicillin G, clindamycin, rifampicin and vancomycin. The major quinone is Q-8. The polar lipid profile consists of DPG, PE and PG. The major cellular fatty acids are C16:0, summed feature 3 (C16:17c and/or C16:16c) and summed feature 8 (C18:17c and/or C18:16c). The DNA G+C content is 61.5 mol%.
The type strain, J-3T (=KCTC 8781T=MCCC 1K09559T) is isolated from activated sludge from Nanhu Wetland Park in Huaibei City, Anhui Province, PR China. The GenBank accession numbers of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the whole-genome sequence are PQ459802 and JBHZGV000000000, respectively.
