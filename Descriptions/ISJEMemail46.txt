The family presently contains the type genus Guptibacillus and another genus Exobacillus. The family comprises species exhibiting either Gram-stain-positive or variable staining, motile or non-motile endospore-forming rods. Most species are aerobic, but some are facultatively anaerobic or strictly anaerobic. The genome size for known species ranges from 3.9 to 4.7 Mb, and the G+C content is between 40 and 40.9 mol%. The members of this family form a distinct clade in phylogenetic trees based on large datasets of conserved proteins. Additionally, members from this genus can be distinguished from all other bacterial genera/families based on the presence of two CSIs (Table 2) found in the proteins, Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and Segregation/condensation protein A, which are generally uniquely shared by the members of this family.
The type genus is Guptibacillus.
