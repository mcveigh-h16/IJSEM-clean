Whole cell hydrolysates are rich in ll-DAP in the peptidoglycan. The predominant menaquinones (>15%) are MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6). The major fatty acids are (>5%) iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, C16:1 cis 9, iso-C16:0 and C16:0. Polar lipid profile consists of PI, PE, DPG, glycophospholipid, unidentified polar lipids and amino lipids. The genome size of strain DSM 116494T is 7.8Mb, with DNA G+C content of 71.8mol%. The strain has one linear plasmid with a size of 533.741kb (accession number CP169549).
The type strain DSM 116494T (=OG2.3T=KCTC 59408T) was isolated from sediment collected from Oker River, Stckheim, Braunschweig, Germany (52 12 35.6 N 10 31 9.7 E). The 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers PQ657469 and CP169548, respectively.

 Scheffersomyces tanahashii (ta.na.hashi.i N.L. gen. n. tanahashii, referring to Masahiko Tanahashi, in recognition of his research on stag beetle-associated yeasts).
After 3 days of growth on YM broth at 25 C, cells are spherical to ovoid (24.527 m) and occur singly or in pairs (Fig. 2). They proliferate asexually by multipolar budding and form single or paired cells. On YM agar after 3 days at 25 C, the streak culture is off-white, raised, with a smooth surface and has an entire margin. Pseudohyphae are observed on Dalmau plates after 1 day at 25 C. True hyphae, ascospores and asci are not evident when the strains are incubated on YM, Dalmau or V8 media. Carbon assimilation is positive for d-cellobiose, d-glucose, d-maltose, d-trehalose, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, sucrose and sodium citrate; negative for d-galactose, d-melezitose, d-melibiose, d-raffinose, dl-lactate, erythritol, glycerol, l-arabinose, l-sorbose, lactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and xylitol; and variable for glucuronate. Nitrogen assimilation is negative for nitrate.
The holotype is BCRC 23563T, isolated on 23 March 2022 from the cocoon wall of a P. astacoides blanchardi (Coleoptera; Lucanidae) reared at the Department of Entomology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. It is preserved in a metabolically inactive state as a lyophilized preparation in the BCRC in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The ex-type culture is preserved at the NBRC in Tokyo, Japan, as NBRC 116731, and at the NCYC in Norwich, UK, as NCYC 4470. The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rRNA gene and ITS regions determined in this study are PQ349791 and PQ349796, respectively. The MycoBank accession number is 857608.
