 Georgenia sunbinii (sun.bin'i.i. N.L. gen. n. sunbinii, of Bin Sun, Professor of the Shanxi Eye Hospital, for his contributions to the prevention and treatment of eye disease)
Cells are aerobic, non-motile, Gram-stain-positive, catalase positive, oxidase negative and rod shaped (0.30.50.81.1m) (Fig. S3B). The strain is an obligately halophilic Actinomycetes, requiring 1.0% (w/v) NaCl for growth with an optimum at 3.0% and exhibiting no proliferation in NaCl-free media. This aligns with the minimal criteria for halophilism as defined by Oren [47]. Optimum growth occurs aerobically around 30C, at pH 7.0 and with 3.0% (w/v) NaCl. Colonies appear yellow, circular and opaque with a wet surface, smooth edge and a diameter range of 0.40.9mm after 3days of growth on BHIB under optimal conditions.
Their NaCl dependency suggests adaptation to hypersaline niches, likely involving ion transport systems and osmoadaptive strategies common in halophilic bacteria [48]. Based on these characteristics, we further compared their genomic features. Through NCBI prokaryotic genome annotation, we identified a multidrug and pH resistance gene cluster (Mrp ABCDEFG) of the cation: proton antiporter-3 (CPA3) family in strains MJ170T and MJ173. This cluster encodes the Na+/H+antiporter subunits ABCDEFG [49]. Research indicates that the Na+/H+ antiporters in Bacillus subtilis 168 and Bacillus halodurans C-125 contribute to salt tolerance and pH homeostasis [49, 50]. Annotation via the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB; http://www.tcdb.org/) detected Na+/H+ antiporters in all two strains. This suggests that the Mrp gene cluster in the two Georgiana strains may also encode Na+/H+ antiporters and play a role in salt tolerance. The schematic diagram of the Mrp gene cluster in strains MJ170T and MJ173 is shown in Fig. S7.
Additionally, secondary metabolite prediction identified ectoine biosynthesis genes in the type strain MJ170T. Ectoine, a canonical compatible solute in halophiles, confirms their capacity for synthesizing osmoprotectants  a hallmark of halophilic adaptation [51]. The associated gene information is detailed in Table S2, and the genomic arrangement is depicted in Fig. S2.
