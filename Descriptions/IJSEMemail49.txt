Description of Chryseobacterium cupriresistens sp. nov.
 Chryseobacterium cupriresistens (cu.pri.re.sist'ens. L. neut. n. cuprum, copper; L. part. adj. resistens, resisting; N.L. part. adj. cupriresistens, copper resisting).
Cells are aerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Colonies are circular, convex and mucoid and produce an orange pigment (flexirubin-type pigment), with a maximum colony diameter of 6mm after 72h on TSA medium. After 72h of incubation, optimal growth was observed on TSA, NA and LB agar and moderate growth on MacConkey agar. Growth occurred within a temperature range of 10C44C (optimum 28C) and a pH range of 510 (optimum pH 7). This species tolerates up to 3% (w/v) NaCl on TSA medium and is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. Nitrate reduction, the VogesProskauer reaction and H2S production are negative. Skimmed milk, CMC, aesculin, urea, Tween 20 and Tween 80 are hydrolyzed. Amylase and lipase are not present. The PGP features found include siderophores and IAA production. It utilizes citrate, sucrose, glycerol, d-maltose and d-mannitol as carbon sources but not l-arabitol, d-cellobiose, d-glucose, d-sorbitol, d-tagatose, d-trehalose, l-malate, l-lactate, adonitol, malonate or palatinose. It hydrolyzes -N-acetyl-glucosamine, l-glutamine, l-tyrosine, l-asparagine, l-lysine, l-arginine, l-proline and l-glycine but not l-isoleucine, l-glutamic acid, l-alanine or l-histidine as a carbon or nitrogen source. The strain contains PE, PG, GL and UAGL as polar lipids. The major fatty acids are iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH, summed feature 9 (iso-C17:19c) and summed feature 3 (C16:16c and/or C16:17c). The genome size is 5.0Mb, with a G+C content of 36.7mol% (WGS).
The type strain EZn1T (=TSD-322T=CAIM 1954T) was isolated from soil contaminated with HMs in Maltaraa, Michoacn, Mexico [19]. EZn1T is a free-living bacterium capable of resisting multiple HMs (especially copper) because it has genes encoding resistance to this metal and could be expressing them.

Cells grow in chains of rods, with a cell size of 04m3.780.78m. It is non-motile and does not form spores. It can be cultivated in PYG for 2days at 37C under anaerobic conditions, with an optimal pH range of 67. As previously described by Kageyama and Benno [5], cells produce acid from glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose and salicin. Fermentation of glucose produces mainly acetate, butyrate and lactate. Starch hydrolysis is positive, whilst aesculin hydrolysis is negative. The cells do not produce gas, indole or hydrogen sulphide, and they do not reduce nitrate or liquefy gelatin. The cell wall contains A1c-type peptidoglycan with an (l-Ala)-d-Glu-m-Dpm peptide subunit. Its cellular lipidome comprises a diverse range of saturated and unsaturated fats. The type strain of C. mitsuokai subsp. mitsuokai is strain RCA14-39T (JCM 10609T=CIP 106738T=DSM 15897T), isolated from human faeces.

Growth is enhanced by supplementation of maltose, sucrose, glucose, cellobiose and inulin. It produces acetate in the presence of glucose. The cellular lipidome mainly includes saturated fats, particularly for LPE, PE, LPG, PG and MGDG classes.
