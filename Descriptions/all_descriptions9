 Description of Pseudomonas beijingensis sp. nov.Physiology and chemotaxonomy
 For phenotypic and comparative purposes, strain T-12T was grown on various media including LuriaBertani (Oxoid), nutrient agar (Oxoid), Reasoner's 2A agar (Oxoid), marine agar 2216 (Difco), McConkey agar (Oxoid), thiosulphatecitratebile saltssucrose agar (Oxoid), tryptic soya agar (Difco) and TYES. The agar plates were incubated aerobically at 201 C for 1 week. Abundant growth was observed on TYES agar plates, good growth on marine agar 2216 and tryptic soya agar, weak growth on nutrient agar and Reasoner's 2A agar, and no growth on McConkey agar and thiosulphatecitratebile saltssucrose agar. Colony development on TYES and Reasoner's 2A agar plates presented as orange, circular colonies with entire edges and shiny surfaces (Fig. S2).
Gram staining and cell morphology were determined using light microscopy at 1000 magnification with a Motic BA410 Elite microscope. The Gram-negative and rod-shaped cells were 0.6 m wide and 1.95.7 m long, as observed under a Zeiss Auriga compact field scanning transmission electron microscope (Fig. 3). Gliding motility was not detected in cells cultured for 24 h on Reasoner's 2A plates. Catalase and oxidase activities were tested using 3% hydrogen peroxide and an oxidase reagent dropper kit (BD BBL), respectively, revealing that strain T-12T was catalase positive but oxidase negative. The presence of flexirubin pigments and Congo red absorption was tested according to Bernardet et al. [28], yielding strong positive and negative results, respectively. Optimal growth temperature was defined using Reasoner's 2A plates at different incubation temperatures (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30 and 37 C), and growth was observed at 525 C (optimal, 1820 C). Tolerance to different pH levels and NaCl concentrations was assessed on Reasoner's 2A agar plates prepared at pH 510 (1 pH unit interval; pH was adjusted with 1 N HCl and 1 M NaOH) and with 06% NaCl (w/v), showing best growth at pH 7.010.0 (optimal, pH 7.09.0) and at 0% NaCl concentration. Hydrolysis of various substrates was tested on Reasoner's 2A agar plates, including casein (1% w/v), carboxymethyl cellulose degradation (0.5% w/v), DNAse (Liofilchem), egg-yolk precipitation (5% v/v, Liofilchem), gelatin (2% w/v), l-tyrosine (0.5% w/v), pectin (0.5% w/v), starch (0.5% w/v) and Tweens 20 and 80. There were positive results for gelatin hydrolysis and growth on plates with Tween 80, but no hydrolysis was observed. No growth was noted on the remaining agar plates prepared for hydrolysis tests. Enzymatic activities were assessed using APIZYM, API20E, API20NE and API50CH systems according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the incubation temperature was set at 20 C, and the incubation period for the API ZYM assay was 48 h. Alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), leucine and valine arylamidase activities were strongly positive; cystine arylamidase, trypsin and N-acetyl--glucosaminidase were weakly positive, and lipase (C14), -chemotrypsin, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, - and -galactosidase, -glucuronidase, -mannosidase, and -fucosidase were negative. In the API20E and API20NE systems, the only positive test was gelatin hydrolysis, with a weak positive VogesProskauer reaction. No reaction was observed in the API50CH galleries even after 1 week of incubation. The main phenotypic characteristics differentiating the Chilean T-12T strain from its closest Flavobacterium species are presented in Table 2.

The fatty acid composition was determined from cells grown on Reasoner's 2A agar plates incubated at 25 C for 72 h. The analysis was conducted at the Bacterial Section of the Coleccin Espaola de Cepas Tipo (CECT, Spain) using the midi Microbial Identification System [29]. The fatty acid content was obtained by GC in an Agilent 6850 system with the Sherlock midi microbial identification system using TSBA6 [30]. The cell compositions of the novel strain and its closest related species are shown in Table 3, and the predominant fatty acids (>10%) were iso-C15:0 and C15:16.

Respiratory menaquinone and polar lipid determinations were performed using cells grown in TYES broth at 20 C for 48 h. The cells, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in an isopropanol:water solution (1:1) were analysed at DSMZ Services, Leibniz  Institute DSMZ (Deustcshe Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturn GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) following standard methods [31, 32]. The menaquinones detected as respiratory quinones in strain T-12T were predominantly MK-7 (80%) and MK-6 (20%). The identified polar lipids consisted of two phospholipids, two unidentified lipids, one aminophospholipid and one aminolipid (Fig. S3).
Based on the results of the polyphasic taxonomic analysis and the distinctions identified in comparison with closely related species, strain T-12T (=CECT 30410T=RGM 3222T) is proposed as a representative of a new bacterial species, Flavobacterium facile sp. nov.
