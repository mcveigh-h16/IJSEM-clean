 Corynebacterium mayonis (ma.yo.nis. N.L.gen. n. mayonis, named after William Mayo, founder of Mayo Clinic).
Cells are Gram-positive rods with clubbed ends. Colonies are white, opaque and non-haemolytic on sheep blood agar at 35C in room air or 5% CO2 after 48h. Growth is observed at 2835C under ambient conditions and at 35C under anaerobic conditions. Robust growth is observed in 0 and 6% (w/v) NaCl but only weakly in 10% (w/v) NaCl. Cells are non-motile, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. d-Glucose and d-fructose, but not d-mannose, d-galactose, glycogen, starch and other carbohydrates, are fermented in the API 50 CH panel. It produces alkaline phosphatase, esterase, esterase lipase, leucine and cystine arylamidases, acid phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase but not valine arylamidase,  and -glucosidases, -galactosidase or trypsin. It is positive for pyrazinamidase, alkaline phosphatase and glucose fermentation, yielding an API Coryne code of 2100104. Chemotaxonomic analyses show the presence of ribose, arabinose and galactose as whole-cell sugars with A1 meso-DAP-direct as the peptidoglycan type. The major cellular fatty acids are C15:0 (21.0%), C16:0 (14.8%), C17:19c (26.2%), C17:0 (13.3%) and C18:19c (18.3%). Polar lipids include DPG, PG and unidentified GLs and PLs. Mycolic acids (3236 carbons) are present. The respiratory quinones are dominated by MK-8(H2) (71.2%) and MK-9(H2) (25.9%), with smaller amounts of MK-7(H2) and MK-10(H2). The type strain, BD556T (=TSD 427T=NCTC 15078T), was isolated from blood at Altru Health System Hospital, Grand Forks, ND, USA, and identified at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. The GenBank accession number for the complete genome of BD556T is CP141643, and the accession number for its 16S ribosomal RNA gene is PP741725.
