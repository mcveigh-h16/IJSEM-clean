 Rhodotorula silvicola [sil.vi'co.la. L. fem. n. silva, forest; L. suff. -cola (from L. masc./fem. n. incola, inhabitant, dweller; N.L. fem. n. silvicola, forest dweller)].
Culture characteristics: after growth on YPD agar for oneweek at 20C, cultures are orange, butyrous, smooth and glossy (Fig. 2a), and the vegetative cells are ovoid, ellipsoidal or elongate (1.36.71.14.4m) and occur singly or as budded pairs; reproduction is primarily by unilateral budding (Fig. 2b). After 1month of incubation in YM broth at 20C, an orange sediment and pellicle are formed. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are formed on CMA and PDA after 10days at 20C. Additionally, sexual structure was not observed in the single and pairwise mixed strain cultures of strain CGMCC 2.7770 and strain UCDFST 81-84 on different media, including CMA, PDA, YM, YCBAS and V8, after incubation at 20C for 2months.
