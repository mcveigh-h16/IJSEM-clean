Preserved M. charantia (bitter melon) tissue of sample BAWM-336R from Marrakai, Northern Territory, Australia, was deposited at the Victorian Plant Pathology Herbarium (VPRI) under the accession VPRI 44369 at Agriculture Victoria, Bundoora, Australia. Sample BAWM-245 was also submitted to the VPRI (accession VPRI 44368). We propose that the genome sequence of strain BAWM-336R (GenBank assembly number: JAUZLI000000000) be considered as a reference genome for Ca. Phytoplasma vignae. This strain was selected as the reference strain because it originated from the Northern Territory where ViLL phytoplasmas were first reported [1]. The 16S rRNA nucleotide sequence analyses also indicate a close relationship of strain BAWM-336R with that of previous detections in the Northern Territory (Fig. 2).
The results presented here provide multiple lines of evidence using more than one sample to support the description of ViLL as a novel phytoplasma species, including comparisons of gene sequence identities (16S rRNA gene) and reconstructing phylogenies (16S rRNA gene and shared single-copy orthologues). These analyses are in-line with the updated recommendations for phytoplasma species descriptions [8] and are an improvement over the traditional approaches that only considered the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and RFLP [7], which represent a very small fraction of the genome and are much less informative for establishing taxonomic relationships among Ca. Phytoplasma species.
The genomes obtained in this study serve as an essential resource to aid in improving our understanding of phytoplasma evolution, supporting the epidemiological studies of this species, and advancing phytoplasma diagnostics going forward. The preserved material deposited at the VPRI through this study serves as an important resource that should be revisited to improve the quality and completeness of the genome assemblies of these strains in the future. Putative vectors of ViLL were determined to be Austroagallia torrida (Evans) and a Batracomorphus species based on direct PCR analyses only, with transmission by these vectors not yet tested [2]. More work is needed to understand the vector, host, and geographic range of Ca. Phytoplasma vignae. Further work to generate high quality genome sequence data from the close known relatives Ca. Phytoplasma phoenicium and Ca. Phytoplasma omanense will improve the understanding of their taxonomic relationship to Ca. Phytoplasma vignae.
