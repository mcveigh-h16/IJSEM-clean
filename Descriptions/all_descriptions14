The description is essentially in agreement with that given above for the species Lactobacillus amylovorus, with the following modifications.
In the API 50 CH test system (incubation at 37 C for 2 days), acids are produced from d-galactose, d-glucose, d-fructose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, aesculin ferric citrate, salicin, maltose, trehalose, and gentiobiose, but not from glycerol, erythritol, d-arabinose, l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-xylose, d-adonitol, methyl -d-xylopyranoside, l-sorbose, l-rhamnose, dulcitol, inositol, d-sorbitol, methyl -d-mannopyranoside, lactose, inulin, melezitose, xylitol, d-lyxose, d-tagatose, d-fucose, l-fucose, d-arabitol, l-arabitol, gluconate, 2-keto-gluconate, and 5-keto-gluconate. Variable reactions are observed for acid production from d-mannose, d-mannitol, methyl -d-glucopyranoside, amygdalin, arbutin, cellobiose, melibiose, sucrose, raffinose, starch, glycogen, and turanose. This proposed subspecies ferments several -glucosides including aesculin, salicin and gentiobiose with variable reactions for arbutin, amygdalin and cellobiose. In the API ZYM test system, positive reactions are observed for esterase (C4), leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, -glucosidase, and -glucosidase. Negative reactions are obtained from alkaline phosphatase, esterase lipase (C8), trypsin, -chymotrypsin, N-acetyl--glucosaminidase, -mannosidase, and -fucosidase. The reactions of the following enzymes vary: lipase (C14),cystine arylamidase, -galactosidase, -galactosidase, and -glucuronidase. The type strain is ATCC 33620T (=CCUG 27201T=CIP 102989T=DSM 20531T=JCM 1126T=LMG 9496T=NCAIM B.01458T=NRRL B-4540T), isolated from cattle waste-corn fermentation.

The bacterium is Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, cytochrome oxidase-negative, facultatively anaerobic, homofermentative, and rod-shaped. The bacteria are 0.50.7 m wide and 3.07.0 m long. Colonies grown on MRS agar plates at 37 C for 3 d under anaerobic conditions are 1.02.0 mm in diameter and milky white, round, and glossy in appearance. This strain does not produce any gas from glucose; both d- and l-lactate are produced as end products of glucose (D/L, 40:60). Growth occurs at 3045 C (optimum, 37 C), pH 5.08.0 (optimum, pH 6.0), and with NaCl concentrations of 1.03.0% (w/v). In the API 50 CH test system (incubation at 37 C for 2 days), acids are produced from d-glucose, d-fructose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, aesculin ferric citrate, maltose, lactose, sucrose, and starch, but not from glycerol, erythritol, d-arabinose, l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-xylose, d-adonitol, methyl -d-xylopyranoside, l-sorbose, l-rhamnose, dulcitol, inositol, d-mannitol, d-sorbitol, methyl -d-mannopyranoside, methyl -d-glucopyranoside, amygdalin, arbutin, salicin, melibiose, inulin, melezitose, glycogen, xylitol, gentiobiose, turanose, d-lyxose, d-tagatose, d-fucose, l-fucose, d-arabitol, l-arabitol, gluconate, 2-keto-gluconate, and 5-keto-gluconate. Variable reactions have been observed for acid production from d-galactose, d-mannose, cellobiose,trehalose, and raffinose. For this proposed subspecies, aesculin citrate is the only -glucoside that supports acid formation, but citrate is also a substrate for metabolism of many lactobacilli.
