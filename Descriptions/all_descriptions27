 Meira qingyuanensis (qing.yuan.ensis. N.L. fem. adj. qingyuanensis, referring to Qingyuan Mountain, Fujian Province, PR China, where the two strains of this species were isolated).
In YM broth after 3 days at 20 C, cells are fusiform and cylindrical to elongate (2.02.24.310.8 m) and occur singly (Fig. 3a). Budding is polar. After 1 month at 20 C in stationary cultures, a sediment and a ring are present. On YM agar after 1 month at 20 C, the streak culture is pale-white to yellowish-cream, tough and wrinkled, and the margin is eroded. On YPGA and PDA after 6 days at 20 C, hyphae with fusiform blastoconidia are formed (Fig. 3b, c).
