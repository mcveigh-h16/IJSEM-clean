 S. praecaptivus subsp. praecaptivus subsp. nov. (prae.cap.tivus, L. prep. prae, before; L. masc. adj. captivus, taken prisoner; N.L. masc. adj. praecaptivus, not yet taken prisoner).
The description of this subspecies follows the species description of S. praecaptivus with the following additions.
Colonies are mucoid and grow to 12 mm in diameter after 24 h of growth at 30 C on LB agar plates. Growth is observed on LB agar, MacConkey agar, Columbia blood agar, Mitsuhashi and Maramorosch medium blood agar and M9 minimal salt agar from 25 C to 37 C. With shaking (200 r.p.m.), liquid cultures reach an OD600nm of ~0.40.5 after 16 h in LB media at 30 C. It exhibits swarming motility on LB agar and grows in LB broth at an optimal pH of 5.5 and a maximum NaCl concentration of 3.5%. In the API 50 CH assay, l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-xylose, aesculin ferric citrate, d-cellobiose, d-lactose, d-melibiose, d-melezitose, d-raffinose, d-turanose, d-fucose and d-arabitol are utilized as carbon sources at both 30 C and 35 C. Starch and glycogen are utilized at 30 C, while inositol, methyl--d-glucopyranoside, amygdalin, d-saccharose (sucrose), inulin and gentiobiose are utilized at 35 C only. This produces catalase and chitinase.

 S. praecaptivus subsp. spalangiae subsp. nov. (spa.langi.ae. N.L. gen. n. spalangiae, of the wasp genus Spalangia).
The description of this subspecies follows the species description of S. praecaptivus. However, this subspecies can be distinguished from S. praecaptivus subsp. praecaptivus subsp. nov. based on different growth properties. The cells are non-motile in both liquid LB medium and on the surface of LB agar. It grows microaerobically in semi-solid agar but tolerates atmospheric oxygen sufficiently to form irregularly sized colonies after 57 days of incubation on LB agar at 30 C. The cells grow slowly in the absence of shaking in LB broth, reaching an OD600nm of ~0.1 after 4 days. Colonies are glistening with entire edges and are capable of growth at 2333 C, with an optimum temperature of 28 C. In the API 50 CH assay, this subspecies cannot utilize l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-xylose, d-lactose and dmelibiose as carbon sources at 30 C. It demonstrates faster growth on N-acetylglucosamine relative to glucose.
The type strain is HZT (NCIMB 15482T=ATCC TSH-398T) and was isolated from the parasitoid wasp, S. cameroni (Hymenoptera: Spalangiidae), collected in an egg-laying poultry facility in Hazon, Israel, in AprilMay 2014, where the wasps develop on pupae of the housefly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).
