 Description of Cupriavidus phytorum sp. nov.Description of two subspecies of Streptococcus mitis
 S. mitis previously included two biovars, 1 and 2 [60]. The subsequently proposed Streptococcus dentisani [61] is identical to S. mitis biovar 2. Genetically based phylogenetic studies demonstrated its relationship to S. oralis, and the taxon was subsequently reclassified as S. oralis subsp. dentisani [2]. Consequently, S. mitis is currently recognized to be identical to the former Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 [60].

 Description of Microbacterium capsulatum sp. nov.Description of Rhodococcus parequi sp. nov.
 Rhodococcus parequi (par.equi. Gr. prep. para, beside, alongside of, near, like; L. gen. n. equi, of a horse, specific epithet; N.L. gen. n. parequi, resembling Rhodococcus equi).
Members of this species are Gram-positive, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative coccobacilli. R. parequi grows well in standard solid culture media such as TSA, BHI agar or LB agar. After 2448-h incubation at 30C, it forms smooth, shiny, creamy to buff-coloured colonies that tend to coalesce over time. Colonies are morphologically very similar to those of R. equi. No haemolysis is observed on Columbia 5% sheep blood agar but gives a positive synergistic lytic (CAMP-like) reaction with sphingomyelinase C-producing bacteria such as L. ivanovii or S. aureus [13, 52]. This ability is shared with R. equi and is the phenotypic expression of cholesterol oxidase production [12]. R. parequi also tests positive in a PCR targeting the R. equi cholesterol oxidase gene choE [14], considered up to now as a species-specific identification marker for R. equi [1417]. The optimal growth temperature is between 30 and 37C. Tolerates NaCl concentrations up to 3% (w/v) and pH values from 5 to 9, with 7 as pH optimum. Tests positive for urea hydrolysis, nitrate reduction, acetoin production, tryptophane deaminase, -glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase. It can be distinguished from R. equi [as tested with DSM 20307T and 103S (PAM 1126)] by a rapid urease-positive reaction (at 24-h incubation), ability to grow at 5C; and inability to utilize Tween 20, 4-hydroxybenzoate and -hydroxybutyrate as a carbon source and l-citrulline, l-ornithine, cytosine, -amino-N-caproic acid and -amino-N-valeric acid as a nitrogen source. The draft genome of strain PAM 2766T is 5.3 Mbp in size with a digital G+C content of 68.98mol%. The NCBI GenBank accession number for the genome assembly is JBDLNV000000000, and the accession number of the 16S rRNA gene sequence is PQ043279. Phylogenomically, R. parequi belongs to sublineage no. 2 of the Rhodococcus radiation (as defined in ref. [11]) together with R. agglutinans, Rhodococcus defluvii, R. equi, R. soli, R. spongiicola, R. subtropicus and R. xishaensis. Genomic similarity indices with its most closely related species R. equi are ANI=88.60and AAI=92.35. R. parequi is avirulent in macrophage infection assays and is assumed to be a non-pathogenic environmental saprotroph.
The type strain is PAM 2766T (CETC 30995T=NCTC 14987T) isolated from equine farm soil in Normandy, France.
