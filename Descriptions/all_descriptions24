 Description of Dyadobacter helix sp. nov.Description of Dyadobacter linearis sp. nov.
 Dyadobacter linearis (li.ne.aris. L. masc. adj. linearis, linear).
The cells are rods (0.51.01.03.0 m), Gram-reaction-negative, mostly in pairs or rarely in linear chains. Non motile. Colonies on R2A medium are mucous and bright yellow. Pigment is flexirubin type, according to the KOH test. Oxidase and catalase positive. Strictly aerobic. Mesophilic, neutrophilic and non-halophilic, growing in the following ranges: 1537 C, 5.5 to 10 pH and from 0 to 1.5% NaCl. Nitrate reduction to nitrite or gas is negative. Glucose is not fermented. Negative for hydrolysis of starch, cellulose, casein, gelatin, Tween 80 and DNA. Negative for urease, indole production from tryptophan and arginine dihydrolase. Positive for -galactosidase, aesculin hydrolysis and delayed assimilation of glucose, maltose, mannitol and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (API 20NE). Enzymatic activities detected in API ZYM include alkaline phosphatase, leucine and valine arylamidases, - and -galactosidases, - and -glucosidases and N-acetyl--glucosaminidase. A weak response is obtained for acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and -mannosidase. Esterase, esterase lipase, lipase, cystine arylamidase, trypsin, -chymotrypsin, -glucuronidase and -fucosidase are negative. Weak acidification of the following carbohydrates is observed in API 50CH/E strips incubated aerobically: glucose, methyl -d-mannopyranoside, methyl -d-glucopyranoside, N-acetyl d-glucosamine, amygdalin, arbutin, salicin, cellobiose, maltose, lactose and sucrose, in addition to a strong positive reaction in aesculin. Unable to grow on any of the 30 sole carbon sources assayed in minimal medium, including yeast extract, suggesting that it has non-identified growth factor requirements.
The type strain is AB67T (=CECT 9623T=LMG 32342T), isolated from a drinking water distribution network in Tona (Barcelona, Spain). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences of the type strain are PQ069724 and CAJRAU01, respectively.
